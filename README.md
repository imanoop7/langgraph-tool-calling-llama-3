## Overview

The `langgraph-tool-calling-llama-3` project showcases the integration of LLaMA-3 with the LangGraph framework for advanced tool calling capabilities. This project includes an end-to-end demonstration of setting up, configuring, and utilizing a LLaMA-3-based agent for executing various tasks within LangGraph.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- OpenAI's LLaMA-3 API
- LangGraph
- Gradio (optional, for an interactive interface)

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required packages

## Usage
### Jupyter Notebook
Open the Jupyter notebook to explore and run the project interactively:

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook

2. Open LangGraph_Tool_Calling_Agent_with_Llama3.ipynb in your browser.

3. Follow the instructions within the notebook to configure the LangGraph   
    agent with LLaMA-3 and test various tool calling functionalities.

## Python Script
To run the tool-calling agent using the Python script:

1. Configure your API keys and settings in the script.
2. Execute the script:
    ```bash
    python langgraph_tool_calling_agent_with_llama3.py

This will start the agent, allowing you to perform tool-calling tasks using LLaMA-3.
